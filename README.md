# Bacteria_Biodiversity
Create and deploy a biodiversity dashboard of belly button bacteria data on an interactive webpage using plotly, javascript, css, d3, html, and bootstrap.

## Purpose
Volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 
If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
